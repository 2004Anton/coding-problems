// Breath First Search
// Graph traversals
// Graph traversal means visiting every vertex and edge exactly once in a well-defined order. 
// While using certain graph algorithms, you must ensure that each vertex of the graph is visited exactly once. 
// The order in which the vertices are visited are important and may depend upon the algorithm or question that you are solving.
// During a traversal, it is important that you track which vertices have been visited. The most common way of tracking vertices is 
// to mark them.
