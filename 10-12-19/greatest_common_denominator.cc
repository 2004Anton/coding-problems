// A fairly routine problem in mathematics is that of finding the greatest
// common denominator of two integers, what we are essentially after is the
// greatest number which is a multiple of both, e.g. the greatest common
// denominator of 9, and 15 is 3. One of the most elegant solutions to this
// problem is based on Euclidâ€™s algorithm that has a run time complexity of O(n
// 2
// ).
